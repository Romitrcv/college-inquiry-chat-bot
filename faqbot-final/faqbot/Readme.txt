This directory contains 2 subfolders named data and models .
The data folder contains 2 files 1st is training_data.json and other stories.md.

training_data.json is our training dataset whereas stories.md tells the state of chatbot at the conversation time to chatbot.Used for prediction.

The other folder is models which contains nlu model named nlu which is generated by running train-nlu.py and another folder named dialogue which is generated by train.py using domain.yml.

First run train-nlu.py to train nlu model using franken_data.json
Then run train.py to generate dialogue using stories.md
the you can use train-online.py to generate stories.
then again train it by using train.py
At last run the bot using run.py

Thanking YOU!!
